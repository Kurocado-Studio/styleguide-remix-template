## Quick Startâ€”"Hello World" in 5 Minutes or Less

1. **Clone the repository**

   - Clone the Repository using the
     [GitHub template](https://github.com/new?template_name=styleguide-remix-template&template_owner=Kurocado-Studio).
     Note that GitHub will clone the template using `Initial commit,` the initial build will fail on
     the [Linting](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/PLA-A-5/Lint) pipeline due to
     `Initial commit` going against [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
     enforced by [CommitLint config](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/STY-A-12/CommitLint)
   - Install dependencies. We use `pnpm,` you can install pnpm if you don't have it already
     [here](https://pnpm.io/)

   - This will enable the [Documentation](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/PLA-A-7/Document)
     pipeline
3. **While on the `main` branch, rename the repository**
   - Change the `styleguide-remix-template` to the application's name
     - on [package.json](./package.json)

4. **Commit changes**

   - Commit changes following [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
